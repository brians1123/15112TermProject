My project recognizes handwritten mathematical expressions - polynomials, exponents, and basic arithmetic, and helps the user to analyze them further. The user is able to edit their inputs in case it is misread, or if they simply want to analyze something that they have not scanned.

To run my program, the modules that you will need to install are:

- pygame (pip install pygame)
- opencv (pip install opencv-python)
- numpy (pip install numpy)
- matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
- pylab (pip install pylab)
- operator (pip install operator)
- string (included)
- os (included)
- copy (included)
- fractions (included)
- pygame_textinput (http://pygame.org/project-Pygame+Text+Input-3013-5031.html)

pygame_textinput can be found for download on this link. Put files in the same directory that the main program is running in. it was suggested to me by TA Sterling Wells. I made slight modifications so that it would work with initial text and so that the program returns and clears properly upon pressing return. For this reason, it is necessary to use the file included with my submission to run my program, instead of the one available at this link
