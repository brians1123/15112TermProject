Notes from user study from class 5/2/17:

Note - my program was crashing a good deal because I was just finishing changing a design feature, so I wasn't able to show my program as fully as I would have liked to

Round 1:

- make help screen more helpful
- maybe make it interactive or not just one page
- improve font
- improve interacticity

Round 2:

- also improve interacticity
- make it easier to display more functions on the same graph
- make arithmetic bigger and easier to read
- make root finding alg more obvious and important
