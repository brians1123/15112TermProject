My project recognizes handwritten mathematical expressions - polynomials, exponents, and basic arithmetic, and helps the user to analyze them further. The user is able to edit their inputs in case it is misread, or if they simply want to analyze something that they have not scanned.

To run my program, the modules that you will need to install are:

- pygame (pip install pygame)
- opencv (pip install opencv-python)
- numpy (pip install numpy)
- matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
- pylab (pip install pylab)
- operator (pip install operator)
- string (included)
- os (included)
- copy (included)
- fractions (included)
- pygame_textinput (http://pygame.org/project-Pygame+Text+Input-3013-5031.html)
